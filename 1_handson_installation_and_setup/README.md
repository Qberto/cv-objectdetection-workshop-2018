# Hands-on: Installation and Set-up

Let's get started by installing and setting up the necessary python packages to run basic object detection exercises. 

## Step 1: Install Anaconda

Context: 

Python can be installed on your system through various means. ArcGIS Pro comes with its own python installation, for example. 

For this exercise, we will leverage Anaconda, a free and open source distribution of Python that simplifies package management and deployment. One advantage of this approach is that it completely isolates any work from your important ArcGIS Pro python environment. 

Procedure:

To install Anaconda, please visit the [Anaconda downloads site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and download the Python 2.7 Installer.
